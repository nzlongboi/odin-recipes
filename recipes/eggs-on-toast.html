        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>1 and a half tablespoons of Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>1 Slice of Bread</li>
            <li>1 quarter cup Shredded Cheese</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p><h2>Method</h2></p>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Crack the eggs into a bowl and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Beat with a fork until evenly yellow. Leave the bowl next to the stove while you make the toast.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>In a small nonstick skillet, melt a thin slice of the butter over medium-low heat. Swipe the bread in the melted butter to soak it all up. Let sit until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add another thin slice of butter to the pan then flip the bread, swiping it in the newly melted butter until itâ€™s all soaked up. Turn the heat to the lowest setting and let the bread sit until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Add the remaining butter and the eggs and cook, stirring gently and constantly with a wooden spoon, until the butter melts and the eggs are half wet and half solid, 15 to 45 seconds. Turn off the heat, add the cheese and continue stirring until the mixture is creamy but no longer wet, about 30 to 45 seconds. Scrape onto the toast right away and enjoy.</p>
